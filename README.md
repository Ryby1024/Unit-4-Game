<h1>Avengers Defender</h1>

Avengers Defender is a numerical based game that will challenge your problem solving abilities. It is a game made using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JQuery. Here is how you play the game.
<ul>
<li>When the game first loads Thanos is given a random score. You are able to see this number value on the screen. His score can be anywhere between 19 and 120.</li>
<li>Each member of the Avengers are also given a numerical value. The only difference is you do not see this number. Each time you click one of the Avengers, your score will go up by how much that character is worth.</li>
<li>To win the game you must match Thanos' score without going over. Even if you go over by just one point, you lose. So if you want to be successful at the game, you need to do some problem solving and figure out each characters value. Each character can have a value between 1 and 12. You then must plan ahead and try to piece the puzzle together to win the game.
